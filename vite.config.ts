/**
 * Refuse to BUILD a marketing site whose pricing CTAs point somewhere that is
 * not an https:// origin — rather than shipping it and finding out in the
 * browser.
 *
 * The first version of this guard was a `throw` at module scope in
 * appLink.ts. Measured: with VITE_APP_ORIGIN=localhost:5173 the build exits 0
 * and ships, because Vite bundles that module and the throw only runs when a
 * visitor's browser evaluates it — every page white-screens, and CI is green.
 * A build-time check is the same misconfiguration caught before anything is
 * deployed, and incapable of white-screening anyone. Same reasoning, same
 * shape, as web-app's requireApiBase (marketing-website#46 review F2).
 *
 * Reads loadEnv, not bare process.env, so a .env file satisfies it as well as
 * the deploy step's env: — a guard whose remedy text names a file it does not
 * read is the JAR-1115 defect.
