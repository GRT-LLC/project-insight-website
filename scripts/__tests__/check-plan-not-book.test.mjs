// Test which directories and extensions the plan-not-book guard actually reads.
//
// The guard's matching is already hardened (NFKC folding, zero-width stripping,
// a confusables map) and reviewed. What was never checked is its *reach*: it
// scanned `src` only, with no `.txt` in its extension set, so everything under
// `public/` was invisible to it.
//
// That is not hypothetical. public/llms.txt advertised "aggregate pricing
// across booking platforms" for months, served verbatim to every crawler and
// agent that asked, while CI reported the guard passing on every commit
// (JAR-20). A guard that cannot see published copy is not guarding it.
//
// So these cases assert coverage, not regexes: drop banned language into a
// published file and the guard must fail on it.
