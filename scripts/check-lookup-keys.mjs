// The price lookup_keys are the contract this repo shares with core and web-app
// (JAR-1197). The canonical set is generated in core (config/stripe/lookup-keys.json)
// and published here, at contracts/stripe-lookup-keys.json, because marketing-website
// is the one public repo every consumer's CI can fetch without a credential.
//
// This guard asserts marketing's own list — the PRICES keys in
// src/app/data/pricing.ts — is exactly the published canonical set. A key added
// to the catalogue in core without updating pricing.ts (or the reverse) fails
// this PR rather than the pricing page at runtime. core's own CI asserts the
// published copy still equals core's canonical, closing the loop.
//
// No credential and no network: this reads two files in the repo. `--allow-skip`
// is intentionally absent — unlike check-prices.mjs's Stripe reconciliation,
// there is nothing here that can only run in CI.
